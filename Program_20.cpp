//Problem Statement: Given an array of N integers, your task is to find unique quads that add up to give a target value. In short, you need to return an array of all the unique quadruplets [arr[a], arr[b], arr[c], arr[d]] such that their sum is equal to a given target.

// Input Format: arr[] = [1,0,-1,0,-2,2], target = 0
//Result : [ [ -2, -1, 1, 2 ], [ -2, 0, 0, 2 ], [ -1, 0, 0, 1 ] ]
